    <p>But that's not where it ends!</p>
    <p>At Autistic Led, it's all about meeting your own communication preferences as much as possible. So we have group chats on <strong>WhatsApp</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> as well as outdoor meet-ups.</p>
    <p>We are always thinking about new ways to bring the community closer together — specifically our autistic community, but also the wider community through events. Check back on the <strong>What We Offer</strong> page or follow us on Facebook!</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-200">A Little About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Callum Brazzo</strong> and I am an autistic adult with OCD and Tourette's, diagnosed at 21 after my alternative journey through mainstream education.</p>
    <p>Poetry was, and still is, my most consistent communication tool — and I wouldn't be here without it!</p>
    <p>I hope that people who connect with Autistic Led can find healthy outlets for their own expression as our journeys vary. Six years on, we are still going strong!</p>
